# Notebooks for Machine Learning Lectures
These are some notebooks to accompany my lectures on machine learning 
given at the String Theory group of ICTS-TIFR and the Dept of Physics, 
IIT Kanpur. The topics covered are:

1. [Generalized Linear Models for Regression](GeneralizedLinearRegression/)
    1. Linear Regression 
    2. Bias and Variance
    3. Regularization
2. [Classification via Logistic Regression](LogisticRegression/)
    1. Binary Classification 
    2. Multinary Classification 
3. [Artificial Neural Networks](NeuralNetworks/)
    1. The Perceptron 
    2. Artificial Neural Networks
    3. How Neural Networks Learn: Backpropagation
    4. Training a Neural Network: choosing Initialization, Learning Rate etc.
4. [Convolutional Neural Networks](ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks/)
    1. A Simple Edge Detection Problem 
    2. Convolutional Layers 
    3. Pooling Layers 
    4. Putting it all together: A basic ConvNet
    5. 1 x 1 convolutions.
    6. Fully Convolutional Neural Networks

The notebooks use Python3, Numpy and Pandas. For machine learning we use 
scikit-learn and Keras/Tensorflow 2.

[Notes](Notes/) contains a pdf file of the lecture notes.

I suggest opening these notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) 
_via_ File --> Open --> and then choosing the GitHub tab.
